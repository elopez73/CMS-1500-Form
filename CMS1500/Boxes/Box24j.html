  <p>The top section of this field pulls the Legacy 1 value for the transaction provider from the Providers window, Provider IDs grid, Legacy 1 column.   

    The bottom section of this box pulls the NPI value of the transaction provider's record  Providers window, Provider IDs grid, NPI column). Note: when creating an entry on the Provider IDs grid, you can pull NPI from the Provider IDs grid or the Practice IDs grid. If you set up a rule to pull NPI from the Practice IDs grid, and not the Provider IDs grid, the application will pull the NPI number from the Practice grid.
