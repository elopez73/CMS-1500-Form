    The values are pulled from the Practice IDs grid, Legacy1  column (the application calculates the qualifier) if the Provider files claims as a group (Provider IDs grid, Group button is selected).
    
    If the provider files claims as an individual (Provider IDs grid, Individual button is selected), then the values are pulled from the Provider IDs grid, Legacy 1 column (the application calculates the qualifier).
    
    The application selects the correct entry from the grid, if multiple entries are present, via the rules engine selection process. For more information on rules entry/row selection see, Assigning Rules.
